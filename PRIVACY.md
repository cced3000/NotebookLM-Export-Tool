# Privacy Policy for NotebookLM Export Tool

**Last Updated: January 6, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the **NotebookLM Export Tool** ("the Extension") handles user data. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.

### 1. Data Collection and Usage

The NotebookLM Export Tool is designed with a **privacy-first** approach.

* **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or account credentials.
* **Local Processing:** All content extraction and file conversion (Markdown, Word, PDF, etc.) are performed **100% locally** within your browser.
* **No Data Transmission:** Your NotebookLM data, notes, and generated files never leave your computer and are never sent to our servers or any third parties.

### 2. Permissions Justification

To provide its core functionality, the Extension requires the following permissions:

* **`storage`**: Used solely to save your local preferences, such as language settings and UI display toggles.
* **`downloads`**: Required to allow the Extension to save the exported files directly to your local device.
* **`scripting` & Host Permissions (`https://notebooklm.google.com/*`)**: Necessary to inject the export buttons into the NotebookLM interface and read the content you choose to export.

### 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with Google NotebookLM to function, but it does not share any data with other third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertisers.

### 4. Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of your data being compromised on our end. Your data remains under your control within your Google account and local environment.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
